Priorities:
- Need to keep track of start time and end time 
- Presentations: Need to keep track of all drop down menus

Misc:
- Capacity is not a string, shouldn't be
- Log out: need to save state (currently, just takes you to page and doesn't save state)
- ? do we want to do something special with save button
- validate queries are returning correct results
- Central UII object
